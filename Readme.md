## Projects:

### Image Classification using CNN

Deep Learning has emerged as a new area in machine learning and is applied to a number of signal and image applications. The main purpose of the work presented in this paper, is to apply the concept of a Deep Learning algorithm namely, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image classification.
- Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular deep learning algorithm for image classification
- CNNs can automatically learn and extract relevant features from input images
- To build an image classification system using CNNs, pre-processing the images is necessary
- CNN architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers
- Training a CNN involves supervised learning using a dataset of labeled images and backpropagation
- Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are essential for implementing an image classification system using CNNs
- A large dataset of labeled images is necessary for training and testing the CNN
- Implementing an image classification system using CNNs is a challenging and exciting project in computer vision with real-world applications
- The outcome of this project is a robust and accurate image classification system applicable to a wide range of image processing applications.
